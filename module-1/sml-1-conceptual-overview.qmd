# Purpose and Agenda

## Purpose (All Modules!)

Machine learning is increasingly prevalent in our lives---and in educational contexts. Its role in educational research and practice is growing, albeit with some challenges and even controversy. These modules are designed to familiarize you with supervised machine learning and its applications in STEM education research. Throughout the module, we'll explore four key questions that correspond to the focus of each of the four modules. By the end, you will have a deep understanding of the key characteristics of supervised machine learning and how to implement supervised machine learning workflows in R and Python.

::: {.notes}
This is from the overview of the module -- it is jsut a high-level overview of the topic.

# Discussion 1

::: {.notes}
The discussions that follow are optional, but they can be really rich.

::: panel-tabset

## Getting Started

- Explain why are you interested in machine learning.

::: {.notes}
This is really just to get people talking - low stakes! Look for ideas related to SML.
:::

## Digging Deeper

- Is there a specific use case of machine learning in which you are especially interested? Consider the data and purpose.

::: {.notes}
Like the above, this is meant to elicit thoughts on SML - try to draw those out, or point out cases of unsupervised ML or regression and try to contrast those.

# Key Concept #1

## Machine learning

![](img/gpt-4.png){fig-align="center"}

*Builds upon supervised machine learning models--namely, deep neural networks, the likes of which can be estimated within R; the big advance has to do with the transformer architecture that allows for the fitting of more complex models. It is still important (maybe necessary) to learn about the foundational techniques and methodologies underlying GPT-4.*

## Defining ML

-   *Artificial Intelligence (AI)* (i.e., [GPT-4](https://openai.com/api/)): Simulating human intelligence through the use of computers
-   *Machine learning (ML)*: A subset of AI focused on how computers acquire new information/knowledge

This definition leaves a lot of space for a range of approaches to ML

## Supervised ML

-   Requires coded data or data with a known outcome
-   Uses coded/outcome data to train an algorithm
-   Uses that algorithm to **predict the codes/outcomes for new data** (data not used during the training)
-   Can take the form of a *classification* (predicting a dichotomous or categorical outcome) or a *regression* (predicting a continuous outcome)
-   Algorithms include:
    -   [Linear regression (really!)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)
    -   Logistic regression
    -   Random forest
    -   Neural network

## What kind of coded data?

> Want to detect spam? Get samples of spam messages. Want to forecast stocks? Find the price history. Want to find out user preferences? Parse their activities on Facebook (no, Mark, stop collecting it, enough!) (from [ML for Everyone](https://vas3k.com/blog/machine_learning/))

In educational research:

-   Assessment data (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09895-9))
-   Data from log files ("trace data") (e.g., [1](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10508406.2013.837391?casa_token=-8Fm2KCFJ30AAAAA%3Altbc8Y8ci_z-uLJx4se9tgvru9mzm3yqCTFi12ndJ5uM6RDl5YJGG6_4KpUgIK5BYa_Ildeh2qogoQ))
-   Open-ended written responses (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09889-7), [2](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-020-09761-w))
-   Achievement data (i.e., end-of-course grades) (e.g., [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10956-020-09888-8), [2](https://search.proquest.com/docview/2343734516?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true))

## How is this different from regression?

The *aim* is different, the algorithms and methods of estimation are not (or, are differences in degree, rather than in kind).

In a linear regression, our aim is to estimate parameters, such as $\beta_0$ (intercept) and $\beta_1$ (slope), and to make inferences about them that are not biased by our particular sample.

In an ML approach, we can use the same linear regression model, but with a goal other than making unbiased inferences about the $\beta$ parameters:

In supervised ML, our goal is to minimize the difference between a known $y$ and our predictions, $\hat{y}$.

## It's the same!

We can use the same model for an inferential or a predictive approach:

$y$ = $b_0$ + $b_1$ + ... + $e$

If we are interested in making inferences about a particular $b$ (e.g., $b_1$), we can use theory and prior research to include particular predictors

If we are interested in making the best possible predictions, we can add a *bunch* of predictors and see how much we can minimize the prediction error

## But different!

This *predictive goal* means that we can do things differently:

-   Multicollinearity is not an issue because we do not care to make inferences about parameters
-   Because interpreting specific parameters is less of an interest, we can use a great deal more predictors
-   We focus on how accurately a *trained* model can predict the values in *test* data (though, we'll only use one data set only in this module)
-   We can make our models very complex - we can choose different models!

## Okay, *really* complex

-   Neutral/deep networks
    -   i.e., GPT-3 (175 B parameters), GPT-4 (\>1 T parameters)
-   And, some models can take a different form than familiar regressions:
    -   *k*-nearest neighbors
    -   Decision trees (and their extensions of bagged and random forests)
-   Last, the modeling process can look different:
    -   Ensemble models that combine or improve on ("boosting") the predictions of individual models

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you have coded data or data with a known outcome -- let's say about K-12 students -- and, do you want to:

-   *Predict* how other students with similar data (but without a known outcome) perform?
-   *Scale* coding that you have done for a sample of data to a larger sample?
-   *Provide timely or instantaneous feedback*, like in many learning analytics systems?

**Supervised methods may be your best bet**

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you not yet have codes/outcomes -- and do you want to?

-   *Achieve a starting point* for qualitative coding, perhaps in a ["computational grounded theory"](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0049124117729703) mode?
-   *Discover groups or patterns in your data* that may be of interest?
-   *Reduce the number of variables in your dataset* to a smaller, but perhaps nearly as explanatory/predictive - set of variables?

**Unsupervised methods may be helpful**

## Which technique should I choose?

Do you want to say something about one or several variables' relations with an outcome?

-   Understand whether an intervention was effective
-   See how one or more variables relates to an outcome

**Traditional inferential statistics may be best**

## Example of machine learning in STEM Edu Research

**Combining best practices in assessment with supervised ML**

> Maestrales, S., Zhai, X., Touitou, I., Baker, Q., Schneider, B., & Krajcik, J. (2021). Using machine learning to score multi-dimensional assessments of chemistry and physics. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 30(2), 239-254.

-   Carrying out a careful process of qualitative coding (and the establishment of validity and interrater reliability) of students' written constructed responses
-   Training a supervised ML algorithm in advance of being able to **scale up** their coding to a larger number of responses

# Discussion 2

::: panel-tabset

## Reflecting

-   When might you use SML, in general?

## Applying

-   Think back to the use case you mentioned earlier. How does (or could) SML be an appropriate technique to use?
:::

::: {.notes}
This is meant to elicit thoughts from learners on SML, now that we are beginning to develop a language. Learners may mention research questions that sound like they could be answered using traditional inferential methods - lean into those discussions and be open to the possibility that interesting questions do *not* require SML, and use these conversations to try to shape inferential (i.e., those answerable with regression models and their extensions) questions into predictive (i.e., those answerable with SML) ones.

# Modules Overview

::: panel-tabset
## Module 1

**SML Module 1: Foundations**

How is prediction different from explanation? This lab provides a gentle introduction to supervised machine learning by drawing out similarities to and differences from a regression modeling approach. The case study will involve modeling the graduation rate across 1000s of higher education institutions in the United States using data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).

## Module 2

**SML Module 2: Workflows With Training and Testing Data**

Building on the foundations from Lab 1, this session delves deeper into the workflows we will use when we are using a SML approach. Particularly, we'll explore the roles of training and testing data and when to use them in a SML workflow. We'll predict students' withdrawal from a course using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD).

## Module 3

**SML Module 3: Interpreting SML Metrics**

How is the interpretation of SML models different from more familiar models? In this lab, we'll explore and work to understand the confusion matrix that can and the various metrics (e.g., precision, recall, PPV, NPV, F-score, and AUC) that are used to interpret how good at making dichotomous predictions SML models are. We'll again use the OULAD, augmenting the variables we used in Lab 1, and we'll introduce a more complex model---the random forest model---as an alternative to the regression models used in previous labs.

## Module 4

**SML Module 4: Improving Predictions Through Feature Engineering**

How can we improve our predictions? This lab introduces the concept of feature engineering to enhance model performance. We'll explore techniques for creating new variables and refining existing ones to improve prediction accuracy. We also explore cross-validation to revise and refine our model without biasing its predictions. We'll work with the finest-grained OULAD data—interaction data—to demonstrate key feature engineering steps.
:::

::: {.notes}
A key point to make here is that each lab introduces a tension/issue that is resolved by the subsequent labs - the first doesn't use training data, which can lead to over-confident (i.e., biased) metrics of predictive accuracy; the second introduces testing data, but only naively interprets the predictive goodness of the models; the third includes the major components apart from feature engineering and resampling (feature engineering), which is the focus of the fourth. By the fourth, learners will engage will all of the fundamental elements of a supervised machine learning analysis.
