As a reminder, to earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts:

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply an analytic technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Part A:

1.  How interpretable or useful is the solution we estimated in the case study?

-   

2.  How might a qualitative analysis follow from the Latent Profile Analysis we carried out? What steps could you take in a qualitative investigation? Think broadly and creatively here!

-   

Part B: Once last time, use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies unsupervised machine learning to an educational context aligned with your research interests. More specifically, **locate a study that involve using Latent Profile Analysis or a similar method**. You may find the published papers that have used LPA helpful in this respect; those can be browsed [here](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C34&q=tidylpa&btnG=).

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   

2.  What research questions were the authors of this study trying to address using Latent Profile Analysis or a similar method?

    -   

3.  What were the results of these analyses?

    -   

4.  Lastly, what value might a Computational Grounded Theory analysis have in the context of their analysis?

    -   

### Part II: Data Product

Like the last data product, this one may be a challenge, too. Here, estimate latent profiles using *your own data*. If you do not have ready access to appropriate data (for LPA, continuous/numeric data), choose any of the data sets in the `data` folder of this repository.

```{r}

```

Please interpret the results of your analysis below. What did you find? How interpretable and useful are the profiles? And, what next steps - including those involving qualitative analysis - might you take to deepen this analysis?

### Knit and Publish

Complete the following steps to knit and publish your work:

1.  First, change the name of the `author:` in the [YAML header](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/rmarkdown-anatomy.html#yaml-metadata) at the very top of this document to your name. The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn't actually display in the final output.

2.  Next, click the knit button in the toolbar above to "knit" your R Markdown document to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder. You should see a formatted webpage appear in your Viewer tab in the lower right pan or in a new browser window. Let's us know if you run into any issues with knitting.

3.  Finally, publish your webpage on Posit Cloud by clicking the "Publish" button located in the Viewer Pane after you knit your document. See screenshot below.

### Receiving Your Machine Learning Badge

To receive credit for this assignment and earn your fourth ML badge, share the link to published webpage under the next incomplete badge artifact column on the 2023 LASER Scholar Information and Documents spreadsheet: <https://go.ncsu.edu/laser-sheet>. 

Once your instructor has checked your link, you will be provided a physical version of the badge below!
